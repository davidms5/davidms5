# Hi, I'm David Medina 👋

I'm a passionate web developer with expertise in various programming languages and frameworks. When I'm not crafting code, I delve into the realms of science and productivity, and I'm even known to spin a tale or two in the realm of future fiction. Here's a glimpse into what makes me tick:

## 💻 Technical Wizardry

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust, PHP
- **Frameworks**: Reactjs, Express, Spring Boot, Django, React Native, Laravel, fastAPI, flutter

Whether it's building dynamic web applications, creating scalable backends, or developing cross-platform mobile apps, I'm always up for a coding challenge.

My curiosity extends beyond code. I'm fascinated by the world of physics and technology. From the mysteries of the cosmos to the latest advancements in tech, I'm always eager to learn and discuss.

## 📈 Productivity Enthusiast

I believe in the power of productivity tools to streamline work and life. Two of my favorites are:

- **Obsidian**: My digital notebook for organizing thoughts, ideas, and knowledge.
